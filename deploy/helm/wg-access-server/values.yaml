# sysctlInitContainer flag adds an initContainer named "init-sysctl" to wg-access-server deployment.
# The goal is to set the sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 to allow packet routing through node.
# This initContainer needs to run as privileged, but this is only limited to
# the initContainer run time, the main container will remain unprivileged as expected.
# Use case : 
#   DNS is functionning properly through VPN but does not work for standard traffic. 
# NB : If you have no problem with wireguard traffic, you should not enable this initContainer
